PPI::Xref is a Perl module for generating cross-references of Perl code.

You do need PPI and Sereal installed.

The Perl code being parsed is not executed, so any fancy runtime
(or compile-time) trickery is not detected.  This includes things
like string evals, importing of symbols, and run-time inclusion of
files.  This is both a bug and a feature.

At the moment, any sub definitions are detected (but not declarations),
and use/no/require/do are recursively followed.

Given some code to parse, you can query things like the subs defined
and their location in the code (file, line, even column, and where
they finish), package declarations seen, and so forth.

util/ppixref is a command-line frontend utility for using PPI::Xref.

Note that if you want to use the caching feature (and you should) you
need to create the cache directory first.  For testing, just example:

  mkdir /tmp/cache

and then

  ppixref ... --cache_directory=/tmp/cache ...

Another utility, ppixref-cache-update, can be used to explicitly
update an existing cache directory.
